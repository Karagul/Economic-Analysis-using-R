# Why this course?

Fill in the gaps left by traditional econometrics and methods classes using less flexible econometrics and statistical packages.

- Practical skills that tools that will benefit your dissertation (master or doctoral) and future professional career.
- Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

Data science skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core 'metrics oeuvre familiar to economists.

- Data viz, cleaning and wrangling; programming; cloud computation; relational databases; machine learning basics; etc.

school."*

# Grading

| Component                           | Weight |
|:-|-:|
| 2 × homework assignments (15% each) | 30% |
| 1 × research project            		| 60% |
|	In-class participation						  | 10% |

- You can swap out one homework assignment for an (approved) final presentation of your own research.
- We'll get to research project later in the course.

### Research project

- Your final research project will be an analysis in which you apply some techniques covered during the course. 

- Your research project should look like such as this R markdown `template`: (Read the full document [here]: (https://github.com/antonio1970/Economic-Analysis-using-R/tree/master/Template%20research%20project).)

- You can also have a flavour of potential research projects (maybe beyond the course material (see next slide)

# Why R and RStudio? (cont.)

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

### Bridge to applied economics and other tools

- Already has all of the statistics and econometrics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.

- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.). The same tools are available in Matlab.

# Some R basics

1. Everything is an object.

2. Everything has a name.

3. You do things using functions.

4. Functions come pre-written in packages (i.e. "libraries"), although you can — and should — write your own functions too.

--

</br>

Points 1. and 2. can be summarised as an [object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) approach.
  - This may sound super abstract now, but we'll see *lots* of examples over the coming weeks that will make things clear.

---

# R vs Stata

If you're coming from Stata, some additional things worth emphasizing:

- Multiple objects (e.g. data frames) can exist happily in the same workspace. 
   - No more `keep`, `preserve`, `restore` hackery.
   - This is a direct consequence of the OOP approach.

- You will load packages at the start of every new R session. Make peace with this.
  - "Base" R comes with tons of useful in-built functions. It also provides all the tools necessary for you to write your own functions. 
  - However, many of R's best data science functions and tools come from external packages written by other users.

- R easily and infinitely parallelizes. For free.
  - Compare the cost of a [Stata/MP](https://www.stata.com/statamp/) license, nevermind the fact that you effectively pay per core...

- You don't need to `tset or xtset` your data. (Although you can too.)

# R code example (linear regression)

```{r}
fit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)
summary(fit)
```

---

# Base R plot

```{r cars_basefig, dev="svg"}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1)) ## Just for nice plot margins on this slide deck
plot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

---

# Examples using ggplot2

```{r gapm_plot, dev="svg"}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder) ## For the gapminder data
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# Brief aside: The gapminder dataset

Because we're going to be plotting the [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder) dataset, it is helpful to know that it contains panel data on life expectancy, population size, and GDP per capita for 142 countries since the 1950s.

```{r gapm}
gapminder
```

# What else? (cont.)

Elaborate extension: Animation! (See the next slide for the resulting GIF.)
```{r gganim1, eval=FALSE}
# library(gganimate)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

---

# What else? (cont.)

```{r ggamin2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) + 
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'Log (GDP per capita)', y = 'Life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```

# What else? (cont.)

There's a lot more to say, but I think we'll stop now for today's lecture.

Rest assured, you will be using ggplot2 throughout the rest of this course and developing your skills along the way.

In the meantime, I want you to do some reading and practice on your own. Pick either of the following (or choose among the litany of online resources) and work through their examples:
- [Chapter 1](https://www.jaredlander.com/r-for-everyone/table-of-contents/) of *R for Everyone: Advance and Analytics and Graphics* by Jared P. Lander.
- [Chapter 1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) of *R for Data Science* by G. Grolemund and H. Wickham. (Or just try a chapter at random.)
